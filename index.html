      <h3>Violence is the shape of god.</h3>
      <p class="lore">Bleeding gums weep rancid pink muck or grime which I slosh about in playfully as a pig or other beast in the throes of joy perhaps induced perhaps produced
      but joy none the less. and the sky is neon red hexadecimal ff0000 encasing a turquoise sun like blood on the floor of a catacomb.
      and the grinning tombstones look so, so, like teeth but that cannot be as i am here to eat god but god will eat me. 
      death is a test i cannot pass and i hold on to my rotting ego.</p>
      <h3>I intend to destroy him.</h3>
